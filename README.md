Front-End Vs. Back-End Web Development
Ansewers:front-end web development deals with creating visually interactive interfaces, while back-end web development focuses on server-side functionalities and data management. Both are essential for building a complete, functional, and user-friendly website. Front-end and back-end often work together closely to ensure seamless integration between the user interface

Able To Articulate The Process Of Server Request/Response
Ansewers:the server request/response process is the backbone of how web applications function, allowing users to interact with and receive content from servers over the internet.

Able To Identify Front-End Web Dev Languages
Ansewers:Front-end developers use these languages and frameworks in combination to create user-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing websites and web applications.

Able To Identify Back-End Web Dev Languages
Ansewers:Back-end developers use these technologies to handle server-side logic, manage databases, and handle various application operations, enabling the web application to provide dynamic content and functionality to users.

Static Vs. Dynamic Webpage
Ansewers:static webpages are fixed and don't change over time, while dynamic webpages are interactive and can adapt their content based on various factors. The choice between static and dynamic webpages depends on the specific needs and requirements of the website or web application being developed. Static pages are suitable for simple, straightforward content, while dynamic pages are more suitable for complex and interactive experiences.

Able To Distinguish Between The Front-End Web Dev Languages Syntax
Ansewers:HTML is used for defining the structure of a web page, CSS is used for styling the HTML elements, and JavaScript is used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage. The combination of these three languages allows developers to create visually appealing and interactive web experiences for users.

Folder Structure
Ansewers:folder structure example, and for larger projects, you may need to add more folders or organize them differently. The key is to have a logical and consistent organization to make the project easily manageable for you and your team. Additionally, consider using task runners or build tools (e.g., webpack, Gulp) to automate tasks like compiling and minifying CSS

Files Vs. Folders
Ansewers:files are individual units of data, while folders are containers used to organize and group related files together. The combination of files and folders is crucial for managing and accessing data efficiently in computer systems.

Filenames and File Extensions
Ansewers:filenames are used to name and identify individual files, while file extensions are added to filenames to specify the type or format of the file. Together, they form the complete file name, which helps operating systems and applications determine how to handle the file appropriately.

HTML Boilerplate
Ansewers:HTML boilerplate provides a basic structure that can be expanded upon and customized to create a complete web page. Developers can add additional sections, elements, and styles based on the specific requirements of their projects.

HTML Elements
Ansewers:HTML elements available. Each element serves a specific purpose and can be combined and nested to create complex web page layouts and structures. Understanding these elements is essential for creating well-structured and accessible web pages.

Opening Tags
Ansewers:opening tags for HTML elements. Each element has its own specific purpose and attributes, which can be used to customize its behavior and appearance on the web page.

Content
Ansewers:content for different HTML elements. Each element has its specific purpose and behavior based on the content provided between its opening and closing tags. As a web developer, understanding and using the appropriate content for each element is essential for creating well-structured and visually appealing web pages.

Closing Tags
Ansewers:closing tags for different HTML elements. Closing tags are essential for defining the boundaries of each element's content and functionality. When writing HTML code, it is crucial to ensure that every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag to maintain the correct structure and prevent rendering issues on the web page.

HTML Attributes
Ansewers:HTML attributes. Different elements support different attributes, and the use of attributes depends on the specific requirements and functionality of the web page. Understanding and using attributes effectively allows web developers to create more dynamic and interactive web pages.
